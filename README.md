# Argumentation-based-Link-Prediction-using-LLMs

The problem of link prediction aims to forecast future connections between users based on the existing network structure and user data. 
Accurate predictions can enhance content discovery, increase user engagement, and optimize information flow
across the network. 
By suggesting relevant accounts to follow, link prediction accelerates network growth and potentially bridges disparate communities, thereby reducing echo chambers. 
It also plays a crucial role in improving targeted marketing, content recommendations, and the overall relevance of user feeds. 
Successful link prediction can lead to a more connected, engaging, and valuable social media experience for users while offering strategic benefits for the platform. 
Applying an argumentation-based approach to this problem can help us extract more relevant information from a smaller amount of data due to the nature of argumentation revealing more useful information about a user’s personality. 
Due to charged nature of arguments on platforms such as Twitter, we think we can perform the task of link prediction more effectively with a small sample size as more traits of the user are likely to be revealed. 
This can be validated by simply checking the accuracy of the system’s prediction and comparing to a suitable baseline. 
A charged argument in this case would be one where there is a back and forth interaction between two or more users on a topic on which strong opinions are held, whether political, social or cultural. 
The main hypothesis of the project is as follows:
An argumentation-based approach to the task of link prediction can outperform traditional baselines on certain metrics.
